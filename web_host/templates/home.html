            The goal of the project is to create a system that can monitor crop health at a low cost for the user. The system will comprise of three core subsystems. Firstly, a piece of hardware that can record NDVI data from the air. Secondly, an analysis and alerting engine that will generate outputs based on the NDVI data. Lastly, a user interface for the user to view their results and aid their decision making and planning.
